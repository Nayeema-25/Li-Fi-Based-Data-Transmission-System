#Expected Output For Li-Fi Based Data Transmission System.

1. MODULATION:

The audio signal was used to modulate the intensity of the LED light.

The LED acted as a high-speed transmitter, blinking rapidly in sync with the sound waves.



2. RECEPTION & CONVERSION:

A solar panel (or photodetector) captured the modulated light.

It converted the light pulses into electrical signals corresponding to the original audio waveform.



3. AMPLIFICATION & OUTPUT:

The electrical signals were amplified using a circuit.

The amplified signal was then fed into a speaker, which reproduced the original audio.
